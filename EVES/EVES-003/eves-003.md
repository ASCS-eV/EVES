## Abstract

This specification defines the structure of an asset in the ENVITED-X Data Space and outlines the process for uploading assets to ensure compliance, security, and interoperability.
It leverages existing specifications, such as the Gaia-X Trust Framework, the Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD Ontologies, and implements privacy layers, validation, and metadata mapping aligned with [Tezos TZIP-21](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/governance/improvement-process#tzip-21-rich-contract-metadata).

## Motivation

Standardizing the definition and upload process for digital assets `SimulationAssets` in the ENVITED-X Data Space ensures:

- Interoperability with existing Gaia-X data spaces.
- Security through CID-based identification and metadata validation.
- Scalability for integrating diverse asset types.

This EVES addresses the need for clear guidelines to onboard assets and synchronize data with ENVITED-X systems.

## Specification

### 1. Digital Asset Definition

The `envited-x:SimulationAsset` defines a digital asset within the domain of simulation including the core simulation data and all necessary files for describing, evaluating, and visualizing the dataset.
All simulation assets MUST be derived from a common `envited-x` ontology defined in the [Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD Ontology Management Base][1].
A data space portal SHALL display the currently supported version of the ontologies like e.g.: `https://ontologies.envited-x.net/envited-x/v2/ontology#`.
Each simulation asset SHALL be compliant with the [Gaia-X Ontology and SHACL shapes 2210][2].
The `gx` turtle shacle shapes are derived from the [Gaia-X Trust Framework Schema][3] and the respective application/ld+json [Gaia-X Trust Framework Shapes][4].
A [GaiaX Compliant Claims Example][5] MAY be generated using the [GaiaX 4 PLC-AAD Claim Compliance Provider][6].

The example implementation in the üìÅ `example/` folder is based on release v0.2.3 of the [ASCS HD-Map Asset Example][7].

Asset examples can be found in the following repositories:

- [HD-Map Asset Example](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/hd-map-asset-example)
- [Environment Asset Example](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/environment-model-asset-example)
- [Scenario Asset Example](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/scenario-asset-example)
- [OSI-Trace Asset Example](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/ositrace-asset-example/tree/main)

### 2. Pinata IPFS and CID Management

It is RECOMMENDED to use [IPFS][8] within the ENVITED-X Data Space for making public data available.
IPFS is a peer-to-peer content delivery network built around the innovation of content addressing: store, retrieve, and locate data based on the fingerprint of its actual content rather than its name or location.

#### CID v1

Artifacts uploaded to IPFS e.g. using services like [Pinata][9] MUST use the content identifier version [CID v1][11].  
In Pinata this is achievable through the API using the `pinataOptions` parameter, as outlined in the [documentation][10].

#### File Naming

Uploaded file names MUST exclude extensions (e.g., use `file` instead of `file.json`) to avoid issues such as double extensions during downloads (e.g., `file.json.json`).

### 3. Privacy Layer

The ENVITED-X Data Space implements a three-tiered privacy model:

| envited-x:accessRole | ENVITED-X Domain                                                      | Comment                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `isOwner`            | <https://assets.envited-x.net/Asset-CID>                              | CID v1, signed URLs, asset credential |
| `isRegistered`       | <https://metadata.envited-x.net/Asset-CID>                            | CID v1, signed URLs, DEMIM credential |
| `isPublic`           | <ipfs://Data-CID> to <https://ipfs.envited-x.net/Asset-CID/Data-CID>  | CID v1, public, indexer to new URL    |

### 4. Asset Validation and Upload Process

The following process is implemented in the [ENVITED-X Data Space][12] portal developed by the Automotive Solution Center for Simulation e.V.

#### Step 1: Client-Side Pre-Validation

- Drag and drop `asset.zip` into the upload field.
- Validate the `manifest_reference.json`:
  1. Ensure JSON structure matches the manifest SHACL constraints.
  2. Verify all referenced files exist locally or remotely as specified.
  3. Locate the `domainMetadata.json` file.
- Validate the `domainMetadata.json`:
  1. Extract SHACL constraints from the `domainMetadata.json` context,
  2. Validate JSON structure against domain-specific SHACLs,
  3. Check if the `@id` is unique within the ENVITED-X Data Space,
  4. If the asset `@id` is already existing the validator SHALL throw an error.
- Validate if items in `hasReferencedArtifacts` are available:
  1. Check if `@id` of asset is known in the database,
  2. OPTIONALLY check if filePath resolves if the access role is `isPublic`,
  3. It is RECOMMENDED to warn the user if references do not exist,
  4. It is strongly RECOMMENDED to add the `CID` as a user to the Manifest metadata.

#### Step 2: Upload Asset to ENVITED-X Data Space

- Trigger the upload process by clicking the "Upload" button.
- Calculate the CID of `asset.zip`.
- Rename `asset.zip` to `CID.zip` and store at `https://assets.envited-x.net/Asset-CID`.
- Store `isRegistered` metadata at `https://metadata.envited-x.net/Asset-CID`.
- Store `isPublic` metadata at `https://ipfs.envited-x.net/Asset-CID/Data-CID`.
- Calculate CIDs for all `isPublic` data.
- Create `envited-x_manifest.json` by replacing relative paths in `manifest_reference.json` with IPFS/envited-x.net URLs.
- Replace the paths of items in `hasReferencedArtifacts` to the correct filePaths.
- Replace `@id` from `manifest_reference.json` with generated database `UUID` in `envited-x_manifest.json`. This also applies for referenced artifacts.
- Create `tzip21_token_metadata.json` and map the metadata fields OPTIONALLY use an application/ld+json conform to the [tzip21 ontology][19].

#### Step 3: Preview Data

- **TBD**: Define visualization and preview mechanisms for uploaded data.
- If a user triggers the "delete asset" button then all data stored in Step 2) is deleted.

#### Step 4: Mint Token

- It is RECOMMENDED to use signed CIDs for the upload to IPFS according to [EIP-712][13].
- Upload `isPublic` information and `envited-x_manifest.json` to IPFS.
- It is RECOMMENDED to verify that CIDs from the IPFS service or software returns the same CIDs as the pre-calculation.
- Upload `tzip21_token_metadata.json` to IPFS.
- Mint token with linked metadata.
- The wallet/SDK will provide feedback if a token was minted successfully.

#### Step 5: Listener and Database Synchronization

- Use a listener to detect mint events and synchronize data with the ENVITED-X Data Space portal database.
- A data space like the ENVITED-X Data Space MUST check if the asset was uploaded through its respective portal:
  - `UUID` from step 2) has an entry in the database.
  - Confirm that `contract` + `CID` and `minter` of tzip21_token_metadata.json are the same as in the database.
  - Confirm that the entries `UUID` and `@id` of the asset are unique.
  - OPTIONALLY check if the EIP-712 signature of the tzip21_token_metadata.json matches the user who initiated the mint (SHALL only be known to the respective portal).
- If the asset is not yet in DB OPTIONALLY mark it as foreign asset and add the `publisher` information to the DB.
- It is RECOMMENDED to verify the asset in reverse order as in step 1).
- Only public information of assets can be verified if uploaded through another portal than ENVITED-X data space.

### 5. Database Synchronization

#### @id and CID as the Primary Identifier

- The CID of the uploaded `asset.zip` serves as the unique identifier detecting identical datasets across all systems.
- In addition the unique identifier `@id` of the `envied-x:SimulationAsset` in the `domainMetadata.json` SHALL be used for identification of the digital assets.
- The CIDs MAY be signed by the user according to EIP-712.
- A UUID MUST be generated for the `envited-x_manifest.json` pre-mint to link the asset with the ENVITED-X database securely.
- The DID of the member associated with the user minting the asset MUST be known.
- DID of the user minting the asset SHALL be stored pre-mint in the database.

#### Pre-Mint Information

If additional non-public information needs to be stored in the database before minting, the CID can associate this data with the minted asset.

#### Synchronization and Security

[EVES-007](../EVES-007/eves-007.md) defines the ENVITED-X Blockchain Identifier URN Schema.
The synchronization between the smart contract as in the [Marketplace Contract Reference Implementation][18] and the ENVITED-X database relies on:

1. The contract identifier on Tezos (current Ghostnet contract):  
   `urn:blockchain:tezos:NetXnHfVqm9iesp:contract:KT1PCaD2kmgCHy15wQ1gpqZUy9RLxyBVJdTF`
2. Search `CID` of `tzip21_token_metadata.json` and the complete `asset.zip` in database.
3. Compare if signature on CID is a `user` belonging to the `member` and if member is owner of token.
4. Check: Uniqueness of CID in database.

### TZIP-21 Token Metadata

#### TZIP-21 Rich Metadata Mapping

Attributes not in the table are static and the same for every mint as in the üìÅ `example/tzip21_token_metadata.json`.
Examples are the first five tags or "publishers", which is always ENVITED-X and the ASCS if the mint is conducted through the [website][12].

#### Custom SPDX license identifier

- Custom license in a LICENSE file in the asset.zip root folder: "LicenseRef-Custom-Commercial-Agreement"
- Custom license in a smart contract as json-ld ODRL policy: "LicenseRef-Policy-Smart-Contract"

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification introduces new processes for asset uploads and is fully compatible with existing ENVITED-X systems.
No retroactive changes to previous assets are required.

## Future Improvements

The compatibility with the current release of the [Gaia-X Policy Rules Compliance Document (Release 24.11)][17] is **to be implemented** in a future update of this EVES.
