## Abstract

This specification outlines the roles and responsibilities of EVES Editors within the ENVITED Ecosystem Specifications (EVES) process.
Editors are tasked with maintaining the quality, consistency, and transparency of the EVES process, ensuring smooth collaboration among contributors.
By clearly defining their scope, this document supports an effective and sustainable approach to managing the EVES lifecycle while fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.

## Motivation

EVES Editors are central to upholding the integrity of the ENVITED Ecosystem Specifications by ensuring that proposals meet established standards and processes.
As the EVES framework grows, it is essential to define the scope of the editors' responsibilities to maintain efficiency and attract skilled contributors to this role.
This specification provides clarity on the editors' tasks, empowering the community to drive innovation while enabling editors to focus on their core responsibilities.

## Specification

### 1. Roles of EVES Editors

#### 1.1 Custodians of the EVES Repository

- Manage the EVES GitHub repository to ensure it is organized, accessible, and up-to-date.

#### 1.2 Reviewers of Specifications

- Ensure that submitted EVES adhere to the template, style guide, and community standards.
- Provide feedback to authors to improve clarity, technical accuracy, and consistency.

#### 1.3 Facilitators of Community Discussions

- Moderate discussions on GitHub including issues and pull requests.
- Encourage constructive feedback and active participation from stakeholders.

#### 1.4 Arbiters of Consensus

- Confirm that community consensus has been reached before an EVES advances in its lifecycle.
- Mediate disagreements while remaining neutral.

#### 1.5 Standards Enforcers

- Verify that proposals align with overarching governance and standards (e.g., Gaia-X, W3C, Tezos TZIPs).
- Ensure interoperability within the ENVITED ecosystem.

### 2. Responsibilities of EVES Editors

#### 2.1 Pre-Submission

- Assist authors in structuring and formatting their EVES drafts.
- Provide guidance on effective proposal writing and submission processes.

#### 2.2 Submission and Review Process

- **Initial Review**:
  - Check for completeness and adherence to the EVES template.
  - Ensure technical accuracy and clarity.
- **Feedback Cycle**:
  - Return drafts with constructive feedback and suggested revisions.
- **Editorial Approval**:
  - Approve EVES drafts for community review once they meet required standards.

#### 2.3 Community Engagement

- Organize public reviews and feedback sessions.
- Ensure diverse perspectives are considered during discussions.

#### 2.4 Advancement of EVES

- Guide EVES through its lifecycle stages:
  - **Draft** → **Review** → **Candidate** → **Final**
- Ensure all advancement criteria are met, including the inclusion of reference implementations.

#### 2.5 Governance and Accountability

- Uphold openness, inclusivity, and neutrality in all interactions.
- Comply with the governance rules of the ENVITED Research Cluster, as outlined [here](https://openmsl.github.io/doc/OpenMSL/organization/governance_rules.html).

### 3. Becoming an EVES Editor

1. **Application Process**:
   - Anyone interested in becoming an EVES Editor can open a discussion in the ENVITED GitHub organization.
   - Tag the current editors group (e.g., `@eves-editors`) in the discussion for visibility.

2. **Eligibility**:
   - Applicants MUST demonstrate familiarity with the EVES process, template, and standards as defined in [EVES-001](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/EVES/blob/main/drafts/EVES-001/EVES-001.md) and this document.
   - New editors are welcome, and all qualified contributors can join to support the collaborative effort.

3. **Approval**:
   - The current editors will review the application and decide based on the applicant's demonstrated ability and willingness to adhere to the standards.

4. **Meetings**:
   - Editors meet regularly in open calls. Links to these calls are pinned in the GitHub organization.
   - Meeting protocols are stored in the `protocols/` folder within the EVES repository for transparency and accountability.

### 4. What EVES Editors Are Not Responsible For

#### 4.1 Driving the Creation of New EVES

- Editors do not initiate or drive the development of new EVES.  
- The community is responsible for identifying needs and drafting proposals.

#### 4.2 Providing Technical Designs or Implementations

- Authors and contributors are solely responsible for technical designs and reference implementations.
- Information about e.g designs and technical implementations are only exchanged for the purpose of defining the specification.

#### 4.3 Advocating for Specific Proposals

- Editors remain neutral and do not advocate for or against specific EVES during the review process.

#### 4.4 Resolving Technical Disputes

- Editors facilitate discussions but do not resolve technical disagreements.  
- The community or an ASCS governance body decides on such matters.

#### 4.5 Ensuring High-Quality Proposals

- Editors review submissions for compliance but are not solely responsible for their quality.  
- Authors and contributors must provide technically sound and complete proposals.

#### 4.6 Promoting or Ensuring Adoption of EVES

- Editors are not tasked with promoting specific EVES or ensuring their adoption.
- The adoption of EVES is the free choice of every community member.
- Community members and stakeholders are solely responsible to drive the promotion and integration of Final EVES.

#### 4.7 Maintaining Approved EVES

- Once an EVES reaches Final status, its maintenance becomes the responsibility of the original authors or interested contributors.

## Modular Governance Model

This specification emphasizes a modular governance model where:

1. **Editors ensure process adherence** but are not burdened with community responsibilities.
2. **The community drives innovation** by identifying needs, drafting EVES, and proposing updates.
3. **Governance bodies oversee alignment** with the strategic goals of ENVITED-X.

## Key Resources for Editors

- **GitHub Repository**:
  - Maintain and moderate the EVES repository at [https://github.com/ASCS-eV/EVES](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/EVES).
- **Templates and Style Guides**:
  - Use and update resources in the `resources/` folder to ensure consistency.
- **Community Platforms**:
  - Engage stakeholders via GitHub issues, pull requests, and forums.
- **Governance Rules**:
  - Follow the governance rules outlined [here](https://openmsl.github.io/doc/OpenMSL/organization/governance_rules.html).

## Backwards Compatibility

This EVES introduces no breaking changes and is complementary to the existing EVES process defined in [EVES-001](https://github.com/ASCS-eV/EVES/blob/main/drafts/EVES-001/EVES-001.md).
