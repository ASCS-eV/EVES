                                <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>A market place requires processes for publishing assets, negotiating contracts, and settling these contracts as a basis for services and billing.
We focus on the negotiation process, since it influences all of the other mentioned steps.
This document is not a technical specification, but rather a high-level process description.
Data standards and specific technology choices must be settled separately.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Gaia-X specifications on the topic are high-level (refer to <a href="https://docs.gaia-x.eu/technical-committee/architecture-document/24.04/other_concepts/#computational-contracts" target="_blank">this</a>).
Existing implementations like the Eclipse Dataspace Connector&apos;s <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol/blob/main/negotiation/contract.negotiation.protocol.md" target="_blank">negotiation</a> are complex.
Beyond that, we have specific goals that are not fulfilled by any specification we are aware of at the time of writing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the market place can mandate the use of pre-approved contract templates to ensure fairness and collect proportional fees.</li>
<li>Finalize contracts in a way that makes them fully provable to third parties, including timestamp, to give legal security to participants.</li>
<li>Limit the information that external parties or the market place operator have access to to a minimum required for safe operation.</li>
<li>Allow providers to make individual contracts per consumer if desired.</li>
<li>Represent the contracts as W3C Verifiable Credentials to leverage synergies with existing components in the decentralized ecosystem, specifically to easily make them usable for access control.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="1-stakeholders">1. Stakeholders</h3>
<p>The ENVITED-X Data Space place <em>operator</em> provides and maintains the market place infrastructure.
The operator also acts as a trust anchor giving access and verifiable identities to participants.
For these services, the operator collects fees from providers based on sales volume.</p>
<p>The <em>provider</em> is interested in selling an asset.</p>
<p>The <em>consumer</em> is interesting in buying an asset.</p>
<h3 id="2-initial-setup">2. Initial Setup</h3>
<p>The operator must set up a smart contract that allows anyone to retrieve a set of acceptable contract templates, which should have the form of ODRL policies.
The operator must run a <em>settlement service</em> that can be used to settle contracts.
Contract credentials are only considered valid once their hash has been submitted to this service, which publishes the hash (directly or indirectly) on a blockchain.
We assume that the provider and consumer run a <em>negotiation service</em> that consists of frontend and backend.
It could be a part of other infrastructure, such as the dataspace connector.
This services takes over communication between provider and consumer.</p>
<h3 id="3-asset-setup">3. Asset Setup</h3>
<p>The provider must register an asset as described in EVES-003.</p>
<h3 id="4-negotiation-process">4. Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>The consumer uses metadata search or similar services to identify an asset of interest, before he contacts the provider to negotiate a contract.</p>
<ol>
<li>The consumer asks the provider for a contract offer (i.e., quote) for the asset.</li>
<li>The provider creates a contract offer referencing a contract template.
This offer contains specific data, such as pricing and usage requirements.</li>
<li>The provider sends the contract offer to the consumer in the form of a Verifiable Credential.</li>
<li>The consumer checks that the offer is correctly signed and that it references a valid contract template.
The offer shall not conflict with the template.</li>
<li>If the consumer accepts, he constructs a contract credential, which wraps the contract offer.</li>
<li>The consumer sends this contract credential back to the provider, to ensure that both parties have the full contract without involving a third party.</li>
<li>The provider validates the contract credential.
In this step, the provider could also choose to ignore the contract.
For example, if the offer has expired.</li>
<li>The provider sends the hash of the contract credential to the operator&apos;s settlement service.</li>
<li>The settlement service locally saves the hash and which provider sent it.
Then, the service commits just the hash to the public blockchain.</li>
<li>The consumer and provider monitor the blockchain to see if the contract has been settled.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the contract is fully settled and the consumer can use the asset.</p>
<h3 id="5-fee-payment">5. Fee Payment</h3>
<p>On a regular basis, the providers send the accumulated fees to the operator.
To ensure the fees are correctly calculated without publishing business statistics, a provider should construct a zero knowledge proof for the accumulated amount being correct based on the submitted hashes.</p>
<h3 id="6-limitations-and-discussion">6. Limitations and Discussion</h3>
<p>We assume that the provider and consumer have an interest in properly time-stamping their contract agreement.
This interest ensures that the operator is aware of any transaction that may generate fees.
Provider and consumer may add a status entry to their Verifiable Credentials to mark the contract or the offer in some way.
This could be useful in the case of a legal dispute to give a contract a disputed status or even entirely revoke it.</p>
<p>This negotiation process heavily limits data exposure, but some information beyond what what is exposed by necessity and design can still be learned:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Third Party</p>
<ul>
<li>Can read number of contract agreements happening on the entire market place in a given time period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Operator</p>
<ul>
<li>Knows the number of contract agreements happening in a given time period for a given provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h2>
<p>This process does not conflict with prior EVES.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>This process is not yet implemented.</p>
